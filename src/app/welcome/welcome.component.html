<h1>My Top 20 Albums of All Time</h1>

<h3>Everybody has their own mental list of their favorite albums.  I decided to nail mine down based on listenability as a complete piece, how much they affected my life, and above all just sheer number of times listened to.  These are the albums that I put on over and over again because I'd just rather listen to them for the millionth time than listen to anythign else.</h3>
